# Code Snippets and Notes

Christy Pickering, Mac Gabhann Lab

This repository contains code snippets and notes from tools I use in my PhD project. I decided to start writing notes when I learned how to do something helpful so I wouldn't have to keep relearning the same tricks.

## Included Topics

* Scientific Format Function in R *(unfinished)*: Series of functions I wrote to better format ggplot axes in pretty scientific format

## Git LFS

Git LFS is used to store the non-text files in this repository. GitHub stores and updates pointers to the image files, and the actual image files are stored on the Git LFS server.
